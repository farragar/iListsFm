MyLovedPlaylists - a weekend coding project.

Generates a .m3u playlist of last.fm users' 'Loved' tracks. 
Parses an itunes library xml file to get file locations on the local machine.

Includes weighted algorithm to compare whitespace-delimited words in track/artist names, to find the most appropriate file.
--This deals with last.fm's auomatic id3tag fixing/track renaming

TODO:Some better error checking, particuarly on XML input,
     Jscript XML parser? Currently using messy regex splitting
     
MAJOR REWRITE: Turn PHP->JScript; can we get this thing running locally?
